Hi,
Find below questions that asked in interview :

Programming questions are :
1: find median of two sorted arrays.
Answer : Solutions added in below commit :
https://github.com/Sufiyan33/Data-Structure/blob/main/DataStructure/src/arrays/ProgramToFindMedianOFTwoArrays.java
Also added my solution in leetCode :
https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/solutions/3781532/java-easy-solution-100-work/
2: water trailing problem.
3: find 3rd smallest number using Java 8
Answer : Please check below code :
  List<Integer> lis = Arrays.asList(12, 34, 53, 1, 3, 5, 6, 51, 64);
		lis.stream().sorted(Comparator.naturalOrder()).skip(2).findFirst().ifPresent(System.out::println);

		int[] arr = { 2, 2, 4, 12, 32, 21, 41 };
		Arrays.stream(arr).boxed().distinct().sorted(Comparator.naturalOrder()).skip(2).findFirst()
				.ifPresent(System.out::println);
